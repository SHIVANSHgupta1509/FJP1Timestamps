Why these timestamps?

For the one who couldnt attend class.
They will before hand know what was covered in the class and can save time watching the recordings. 
On an average one can save 60 minutes for every class following these timestamps!

For the one who attended class.
If they forget some point and need to revise it they can refer these timestamps thus saving time.
Also if they need to revise the class they can just focus on the points they need as they need not watch the whole class again as they already did it.

For all.
If one needs to revisit some concept they can using these timestamps in future.
